            <p id="intro" style="margin-top: 4vh;">Food waste is a serious issue that is widespread all across the world, and as our population continues to increase it is clear we need to work towards cutting down our food wastage. As a race we need to bring more awareness to the problem of food waste, while also educating on how to stop food waste through all kinds of impactful and creative changes in our daily lives. From simple things like squeezing the air out of brought bread loaves after opening to freezing food more, there are many ways to reduce food waste in our lives.</p>

            <p id="homep">Food waste is often thought of as a first world problem, but that is a misconception. Waste can occur anywhere in the world under any economic conditions and can even be more common in places with worse economic conditions. This can be caused by things such as poor transportation, lack of infastructure and bad storage. Due to the widespread range of this problem approximately one third of all food produced is wasted globally. This can be hard to fix as well due to just how much it would cost to mend it, which often leads to more and more food being wasted.</p>
