            <p class="altpara">If you have leftover cooked vegetables leftover from previous nights why not try a vegetable lasagne. With vegetables being a leading product in food waste it could be a good idea to reduce how much you are letting go to waste. The below website around some great recipes from Australia has a perfect one for how to make lasagne and the steps.<br><br><a href="https://www.bestrecipes.com.au/budget/articles/7-ways-use-up-leftover-vegetables/o2bxzej0?" class="altlinks">7 ways to use up leftover vegetables</a></p>

            <p class="altpara">One of the biggest ways to get rid of waste though is via soups. Surplus for vegetables, meat, etc can be used whether raw or cooked. Even stale bread can be used for things like thickening those soups. The below website has eleven different ways this can be achieved from carrots to sweet potatoes.<br><br><a href="https://www.arlafoods.co.uk/recipes/articles/top-11-soups-with-leftover-vegetables/" class="altlinks">11 top soups with leftover vegetables</a></p>

            <p class="altpara">Bread is a pretty common food item in our pantries and as such it is another food that gets wasted a lot. Usually once it goes stale is when it often occurs, but people don't realise just what you can do with that stale bread. The below website lists some recipes for this such as french toast or even a pudding.<br><br><a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/pinch-of-help/countertop-appliances/what-to-do-with-stale-bread.html" class="altlinks">What to do with stale bread</a></p>

            <p class="altpara">When it comes to the harder to use foods such as stalks, bones or even skins these also have their uses. One of the most popular methods for using them and one that I highly recommend is stocks or broths. These allow for the creation of bases for sauces, stews, soups, etc and can also be used to add flavour. The below website has some advice on how to go about doing it.<br><br><a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/cooking-techniques/reduce-food-waste-use-kitchen-scraps" class="altlinks">Reduce food waste-use kitchen scraps</a></p>
