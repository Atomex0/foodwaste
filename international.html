            <p class="inpara">International Food Waste Day takes place every year on September 29th. It was originally established by the United Nations to raise awareness about the growing issue of food waste. Highlighting its impact on hunger, the environment and even the economy. As with millions around the world going hungry we still continue to waste nearly one third of all food that we make. So we use this day to raise awareness for food waste and its effects on so many things.</p>

            <p class="inpara">But International Food Waste Day isn’t just for raising awareness but also for encouraging action. Whether it is something as simple as just more people using older foods in recipes or better storage to conserve food, it all has an impact. It also means that all the water, land, fuel and labor used to create the food that has been provided has not gone to waste. So next time you throw food out think about what needed to happen to produce it and the efforts that went into creating it. I also highly recommend the more info page as you can find more info about how you can reduce food waste.</p>
