            <p class="parag">When it comes to preventing food waste a good thing to start with is fruits and vegetables. Around 53% of all food waste is fruits and vegetables which is why it is such an important thing to keep track of. Firstly make sure you store all produce properly to help extend their freshness, this can be done through things such as airtight containers and a paper towel to absorb moisture. As well as for food like berries or mushrooms don't wash them until they are ready to eat as this leads to mold. While if they do go off try and find other ways to use them such as overripe bananas for banana bread or extra chopped veggies kept for stir fries.</p>

          <div class="paratext2">
            <p class="parag">Also along those lines getting creative with scraps can help, such as using stale bread for croutons or even using older vegetables for soup. By changing how you prep and cook you are able to change your waste drastically and allow you to get more value out of what you are buying. So next time you go to throw some food out take some time to find out if you could use them in some other way. You will be suprised by just how many ways food can be used.</p>
